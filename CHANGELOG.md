## [Unreleased]

### Added

**Touchdown luck**
- New environment multiplier (`m_td_luck`, weight `td_luck` / `td_luck_weight` in
  `model_settings`, default 0.06): a player's red zone touch/touchdown rate, from raw
  play-by-play, regressed toward what his position converts on average — computed
  from the same starter-caliber cohort the baseline projection regresses toward.
  Below 8 red zone touches a rate is treated as noise and sits neutral.
- `player_report` now shows `rz_touches`, `rz_td`, `rz_td_rate`, `rz_baseline_rate`
  alongside the multiplier, and `explain()`'s plain-language summary surfaces it as
  "touchdown regression" whenever it's non-trivial.
- New `features.player_redzone_role` (raw plays → per-player-season red zone
  touches/TDs) and `model.touchdown_luck_multiplier` (the bounded z-score
  adjustment, independently unit-tested).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-12

First release. A live fantasy football draft analyst exposed over MCP.

### Added

**Draft recommendations**
- `who_should_i_pick` weighs projected value, week-to-week consistency, open starting
  slots, and the odds each player survives to your next pick.
- Positional opportunity cost rather than raw value: what matters is the marginal gain
  over what a position still offers at your next turn, not who grades highest overall.
- `plan_my_draft` simulates all your picks from your slot under balanced, zero-RB,
  hero-RB or robust-RB strategies.

**Projections**
- Recency-weighted production across five seasons, converted to your exact scoring.
- Offensive line from adjusted line yards and pressure allowed per dropback.
- Neutral-script pace and run/pass split, measured only between 20% and 80% win
  probability so garbage time doesn't distort it.
- Five-year defensive strength by position defended, plus divisional schedule weighting.
- Injury risk from availability history, injury-report frequency and workload burden.
- Positional aging curves.

**Separation and route efficiency**
- NGS tracking separation and cushion, plus estimated YPRR and TPRR, as an open-data
  stand-in for paywalled charting. Man/zone splits are not reproducible.

**Rookies**
- Projected from draft capital, fitted to ten years of first-year outcomes and blended
  with empirical pick bins so the curve can't extrapolate past the data.

**Scoring formats**
- PPR, half PPR, standard, superflex and TE premium. Consensus rankings are converted
  between formats, since only PPR is published upstream.

**Multiple leagues**
- Named leagues with separate boards, replacement levels and in-progress drafts.

**Platform sync**
- Sleeper (public API), ESPN (public leagues, or private with cookies), or paste from
  anywhere.

**Name resolution**
- Aliases, nicknames, suffixes, punctuation, bare surnames, initialisms and typos.
  Ambiguous names name their candidates rather than guessing.

**Analysis**
- `draft_value_history` backtests consensus rank against actual finish across 913
  draftable player-seasons.
- `value_picks`, `separation_report`, `defense_report`, `team_context`, `player_report`,
  `compare_players`, `rookie_report`.

### Notes on accuracy

Several defaults were calibrated against data rather than assumed, and the reasoning is
documented in `docs/methodology.md`:

- Baseline projections regress toward the mean of *starter-caliber* players, not all
  players. Regressing toward a mean that includes third-stringers cut genuine starters
  by roughly a third.
- Consistency is regressed for small samples, so a backup with three good games doesn't
  outrank proven starters on reliability he never demonstrated.
- Rookie curves are capped at each pick bin's observed 75th percentile.
- Format conversion is damped to 0.6, because draft rooms move less than pure points
  arithmetic implies.
